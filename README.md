## The Three Body Problem

# Unpredictablility
The problem remains unsolved at large. Certain orbits have been found that are stable however since our computers operate on non exact values
our simulations are always faulty. Yet this is still an intresting simulation to work with. 

Simulations rerun after a body is flung and the system becomes a dipole. 

Coded in C++ 
Libraries exist in a precompiled format inside the dependencies folder. However a C++ Compiler is needed (Done with a windows machine so dont ask me how)
